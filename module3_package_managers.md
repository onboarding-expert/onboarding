## Why Use a Package Manager?

Package managers like **Homebrew** (Mac) and **Chocolatey** (Windows) make installing software **fast, easy, and safe**.

- **One command** installs or updates software.
- Avoids risky downloads from random websites.
- Keeps everything **up to date** with minimal effort.
- Saves you **hours** over manual installs.

---

## What Will You Achieve in This Module?

- Install a package manager on your system.
- Use it to install **Node.js**, **Python**, **Git**, and more.
- Learn how to update and manage your tools easily.
- Get ready to build and run real projects!

## Example: Installing a Tool with Homebrew

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install almost any developer tool with a single command.

For example, to install **wget** (a tool to download files):

```bash
brew install wget
```

To update it later:

```bash
brew upgrade wget
```

To uninstall:

```bash
brew uninstall wget
```

**It's that simple!**
